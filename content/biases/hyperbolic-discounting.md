title: "Hyperbolic Discounting"
description: "Discounting is the tendency for people to have a stronger preference for more immediate payoffs relative to later payoffs. Hyperbolic discounting leads to choices that are inconsistent over time â€“ people make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning."
